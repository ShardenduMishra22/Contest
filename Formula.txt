1.)
No of pair that you can choose 
from an array of length 'n' :

nc2 = (n * (n - 1)) / 2 


2.)
It is used to calculate the number of 1s (set bits) 
in the binary representation of an integer i : 

ans[i] = ans[i/2] + (i%2)


3.)
If a = b ^ c : 
then b = a ^ c
then c = a ^ b


4.)
In vector we can insert a number at any given position : 
vec.insert(res.begin() + IdxPosn , NumToInsert)


5.)
No of times an element occurs in an array of odd length :
(((i + 1)*(n - i)+1)/2)

// i+1 is the no of array it will be in from left
// n-i is the no of array it will be in from right
// +1 is for adjustment so cause even always less than or equal to odd
// *arr[i] is to add to the sum where the no of times it is added
